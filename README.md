***COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress Exploratory Data Analysis***

***About***

*I conducted a preliminary exploration of the data using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The dataset I used was obtained from Kaggle and focused on the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations worldwide between December 2020 and March 2022. During the analysis, I performed tasks such as cleaning and organizing the data, as well as visualizing it using various charts and graphs. The purpose was to investigate specific hypotheses and gain insights from the dataset through this initial exploration.*

***EDA***

*Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach used in data science and statistics to analyze and summarize datasets in order to gain insights and understanding about the data. EDA involves examining the main characteristics of the data and identifying patterns and trends.*

***Data Source***

*This dataframe includes country level vaccination data which is gathered and assembled in one single file. This dataframe was taken from Kaggle.*

***Dataset Information***

*The dataset includes the following information:*

1. *Country: The country for which the vaccination information is provided.*
2. *Country ISO Code: The ISO code representing the country.*
3. *Date: The date of the data entry. For some dates, only the daily vaccinations are available, while for others, only the cumulative total is provided.*
4. *Total number of vaccinations: The absolute number of total immunizations in the country.*
5. *Total number of people vaccinated: The number of individuals who have received one or more vaccines. This number may be higher than the total population, considering that some people receive multiple doses.*
6. *Total number of people fully vaccinated: The number of individuals who have received the complete set of recommended vaccine doses.*
7. *Daily vaccinations (raw): The number of vaccinations administered on a particular date in a specific country, but information has not yet been processed by a machine or individual.*
8. *Daily vaccinations: The number of vaccinations administered on a particular date in a specific country.*
9. *Total vaccinations per hundred: The ratio (in percentage) of the vaccination number to the total population up to the given date in the country.*
10. *Total number of people vaccinated per hundred: The ratio (in percentage) of the immunized population to the total population up to the given date in the country.*
11. *Total number of people fully vaccinated per hundred: The ratio (in percentage) of the fully immunized population to the total population up to the given date in the country.*
12. *Daily vaccinations per million: The ratio (in parts per million) of the vaccination number to the total population on the current date in the country.*
13. *Vaccines used in the country: The total number of different vaccines used in the country up to the given date.*
14. *Source name: The name of the source providing the information (e.g., national authority, international organization, local organization, etc.).*
15. *Source website: The website of the source providing the information.*

***Why is an EDA about this Specific Dataset Useful?***

- *Understanding global vaccination progress: The dataset provides information on COVID-19 vaccination progress across different countries. EDA allows us to analyze and summarize this data, enabling a better understanding of the global vaccination landscape*
- *Identifying trends and patterns: EDA helps identify trends and patterns in the vaccination data*
- *Overall, the EDA of this dataset provides valuable insights into the progress, challenges, and impact of COVID-19 vaccination efforts worldwide, contributing to a better understanding of the global response to the pandemic and guiding future strategies for public health*
